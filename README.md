# react-native

I've created this project (my first react native app), to learn more about react-native so i would be able to build native cross-platform mobile application for IOS and Android

<h2>Currently, the project contains the following (I'll keep adding more features):</h2>

-Text input to enable the user to insert a place

-Flast list that shows all the inserted places with an image for each place.

-Modal component to show a specific place details

-Delete button, to enable the user to delete a specific place.

-Redux library has been used for managing application state

-More features will be added to the application...

<h2>To run the application locally on your machine:</h2>

-Make sure that Nodejs is installed on your machine.

-Clone the repository into your machine

-Run <b>npm install</b> command in the same folder of the repository

-Next, in case you are targeting android platform run <b>npx react-native run android<b/>, and for IOS, <b>npx react native run ios</b?
