# react-native

I've created this project (my first react native app), to learn more about react-native so i would be able to build native cross-platform mobile application for IOS and Android.

Currently, the project contains the following (I'll keep adding more features):
-Text input to enable the user to insert a place
-Flast list that shows all the inserted places with an image for each place.
-Modal component to show a specific place details
-Delete button, to enable the user to delete a specific place.
-Redux library has been used for managing application state
-More features will be added to the application...


To run the application locally on your machine:
-Make sure that Nodejs is installed on your machine.
-Clone the repository into your machine
-Run npm install command in the same folder of the repository
-Next, in case you are targeting android platform run npx react-native run android, and for IOS, npx react native run ios
