# react-native

I've created this project (my first react native app), to learn more about react-native so i would be able to build native cross-platform mobile application for IOS and Android

<h2>Currently, the project contains the following (I'll keep adding more features):</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Text input to enable the user to insert a place</li>

<li>Flast list that shows all the inserted places with an image for each place</li>

<li>Modal component to show a specific place details</li>

<li>Delete button, to enable the user to delete a specific place</li>

<li>Redux library has been used for managing application state</li>

<li>More features will be added to the application...</li>

</ul>

<br/>



<h2>To run the application locally on your machine:</h2>

<ol>
  <li> Make sure that Nodejs is installed on your machine by running <code>node -v</code> command</li>

<li>Clone the repository into your machine</li>

<li>Run <code>npm install</code> command in the same folder of the repository</li>

<li>Next, in case you are targeting android platform run <code>npx react-native run android</code></li>
  <li>And for IOS, <code>npx react-native run ios</code></li>
</ol>
